> âš¡ **Why wait for machines to fail when you can see it coming?**  
> This project uses **failure analysis** to spot early warning signs of mechanical failure in a milling process â€” helping prevent downtime, extend machine life, and cut costs.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates how **data-driven analysis** can reduce unplanned downtime by **detecting operational thresholds** that signal machine failure risks.  
Using a synthetic dataset simulating a **milling process**, we performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, correlation studies, and threshold identification to support predictive maintenance strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description  
- **Source**: [Predictive Maintenance Dataset (AI4I 2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020/data)  
- **Size**: 10,000 rows Ã— multiple operational and failure-related variables  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - `Air temperature [K]`  
  - `Process temperature [K]`  
  - `Torque [Nm]`  
  - `Tool wear [min]`  
  - `Rotational speed [rpm]`  
  - `Machine failure` (binary)  
  - Failure types: `TWF`, `HDF`, `PWF`, `OSF`, `RNF`  
- **Note**: This is **synthetic data**, allowing experimentation without risk to actual equipment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Goal  
> **Main Question:**  
> How can operational thresholds be detected to predict and prevent machine failures effectively?

---

## ðŸ›  Steps Taken  
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed anomalies, renamed columns, encoded categories.  
2. **EDA**
   - Explored variable distributions, relationships, and failure patterns.  
3. **Visualization**
   - Boxplots for thresholds  
   - Histograms for distributions  
   - Heatmaps for correlations  
   - Pairplots for interactions  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- **Tool Wear > 200 min** greatly increases failure likelihood.  
- **Torque > 60 Nm** combined with high tool wear is a strong risk factor.  
- **Process Temperature > 305 K** often coincides with failures.  
- Strong correlation between air and process temperature affects operational stress.
